# NB: OS X did not support sharing mutexes across processes until 10.8, at which point support was added for
# pthread_rwlock sharing only (at last check, the OS X pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared man page was out of date,
# falsely stating that sharing is not supported).  pthread_mutexes are simpler, having only one flag, and are
# about 2x faster accroding to some simple benchmarking.  However, this difference is dwarfed by Python
# interpreter overhead, and in order to avoid adding a third implementation, the POSIX implementation
# accomodates OS X by using pthread_rwlocks (only the pthread_rwlock write flag is utilized). win32 does its
# thing, as always.

# The following code is used to determine the ctype type (henceforth, simply "ctype") equivalent to a given
# built-in numpy dtype.  This is needed for the somewhat silly reason that the Numpy API, as exposed through
# Python, provides a method that generates an ndarray view of the appropriate dtype for a given array ctype
# instance.  E.g., numpy.ctypeslib.as_array(thing, shape=thingshape) where thing is an instance of ctype
# ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_uint64) yields a numpy.array of dtype numpy.uint64.  This could be done in a manner
# extensible to user-defined, static datatypes such as record ndarrays and perhaps beyond by instead
# call
#
# A logical next step in either case is to store a dtype string in the blob header for use by the open_with_numpy_view
# function, allowing that function's dtype parameter to be dropped.
